# Hangman

Guidelines: 
When you see the home page, scroll down to see 2 options for hangman games: Classic and TSA edition. Clicking “play” will bring you into the game. Below this, is a button that shows Harold’s (our hangman) story. If you click “Customize Harold”, you can customize Harold however you want!

How To Play:
Guess letters until you guess the entire word or run out of chances and Harold dies. Your goal is to guess the word in less than four attempts. If you guess a letter correctly, it will show all the instances of that letter in the word. If you guess wrong, a part of Harold added to be hung. If at anytime you wish to restart, whether that be to play again or because you lost, press the “reset” button and a new word will pop up. 

How to Customize: 
There are 3 options (including default) for customization for head, arms, and legs. Choose from these options to create a hangman unique to you! This hangman will be seen and used in the hangman game.
